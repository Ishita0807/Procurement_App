Procurement & Sustainability Analytics Platform
A full-stack web application for data-driven, sustainable supplier selection and procurement analysis.

This repository contains the source code for a comprehensive procurement analytics tool. The project's structure and included assets reveal a complete development lifecycle, progressing from an initial business concept to a functional data prototype and culminating in this production-grade web application. The application is the scalable, interactive implementation of the ideas first proposed in the  ¬† 

Sustainable_Supplier_Selection_Tool (1).pptx presentation and later prototyped in the sustainable supplier dashboard.pbix Power BI file. It is designed to overcome the limitations of standalone BI dashboards by offering enhanced scalability, user-specific data access, a custom user experience, and the potential for API-driven integrations with other enterprise systems.

Core Features
This application provides a suite of tools for modern, sustainable procurement management.

üìä Interactive Supplier Dashboard: Visualize key performance indicators for all suppliers in a centralized, interactive dashboard, based on the concepts prototyped in the project's Power BI file. ¬† 

üå± Sustainability & ESG Scoring: Evaluate suppliers based on customizable environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics.

‚öñÔ∏è Comparative Analysis: Directly compare multiple suppliers across dozens of data points to make informed, data-driven decisions.

üìà Performance & Risk Monitoring: Track supplier performance over time and identify potential risks in the supply chain.

üìÑ Detailed Reporting: Generate and export detailed reports for individual suppliers or comparative analyses.

Project Artifacts & Non-Code Assets
This repository contains more than just source code. It includes the key business and data artifacts that provide the foundational context for the application.

Sustainable_Supplier_Selection_Tool (1).pptx
This Microsoft PowerPoint presentation file represents the project's conceptual foundation. It likely serves as the initial pitch deck or design document, outlining the business problem, proposed solution, project goals, and scope for the sustainable supplier selection tool. ¬† 

How to View:
You do not need Microsoft PowerPoint installed to view this file. If you have a Microsoft account, you can upload the file to a free OneDrive account and open it using PowerPoint for the web. Alternatively, several free online services allow you to view PPTX files by uploading them or providing a URL to the raw file on GitHub. ¬† 

sustainable supplier dashboard.pbix
This is an interactive data model and dashboard created in Microsoft Power BI. It serves as the functional blueprint and prototype for the web application's data visualizations, demonstrating the core analytics and data relationships. ¬† 

How to View:
Viewing a .pbix file requires either the Power BI Desktop application or the Power BI Service. Unlike simple documents, these files contain complex data models and connections that cannot be rendered by generic online viewers. The recommended method for sharing this dashboard is to publish it from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI Service and then generate a public "Publish to web" link. For collaborators with appropriate permissions, this file can also be viewed directly in a web browser if it is uploaded to a SharePoint or OneDrive for Business folder, provided the user has a Power BI Pro, Premium, or E5 license. ¬† 

Technical Architecture & Stack
This project is built on a modern, type-safe, and highly performant technology stack designed for building scalable, full-stack web applications. The architecture leverages the Next.js App Router for a robust foundation that combines server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) with a powerful API layer. Prisma is used as the ORM to ensure type-safe database interactions, and Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/UI provides a flexible and efficient system for building a beautiful, responsive user interface.

Category	Technology	Description
Framework	Next.js	The React framework for building full-stack web applications. Using the App Router for server components and advanced routing.
Language	(https://www.typescriptlang.org/)	A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer experience.
Database ORM	Prisma	A next-generation ORM that provides type-safe database access and simplifies data modeling and migrations.
Styling	(https://tailwindcss.com/)	A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
UI Components	(https://ui.shadcn.com/)	
A collection of beautifully designed, accessible components built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. Its use is indicated by the presence of the components.json configuration file. ¬† 

Linting	(https://eslint.org/)	A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, ensuring code consistency.
Deployment	Vercel	
The platform for deploying Next.js applications, offering seamless integration, CI/CD, and global CDN, as recommended in the project's boilerplate. ¬† 

Repository Structure
The project follows a logical structure based on Next.js App Router conventions, separating concerns for maintainability and scalability.

app/: Contains all application routes, pages, and API endpoints, following the Next.js App Router paradigm.

components/: Houses reusable React components utilized throughout the application.

hooks/: Stores custom React hooks that encapsulate and share stateful logic.

lib/: A general-purpose directory for utility functions, helper scripts, and library initializations.

prisma/: Manages all database-related assets, including the Prisma schema file, migration history, and the generated database client.

public/: Serves static assets like images, fonts, and icons directly from the root URL.
